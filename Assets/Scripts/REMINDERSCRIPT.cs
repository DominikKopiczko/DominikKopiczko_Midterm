/* PLANS I SHOULD FOCUS ON
- don't worry about sanity meter right now. Focus on making the "mood" the way you want it to be re: sound and visuals,
- lean into the exploration idea without having to worry about battle at the moment 
- lighting can work as a sprite mask to cover the darkness, or in photoshop make a vignette to overlay on camera
- how can you make sound meaningful? why would you not want to turn off music? why do you have to? (perhaps the light attracts more events)
- big question: how can this be scary without big stakes? without health or sanity?
- (this is first prototype, people might playtest and determine if you need something more)

- music meter goes down as song finishes - cant replenish it, if it ends the game ends.
- fear meter goes up when music is off. If it's high, the game ends. Replenishes when you play music.
- you have to balance music + fear to get to your destination. 

- events that drastically decrease fear: 
    - lights turn off
    - car on the road
    - random people passing by
    - a scary noise
    - your music suddenly stops
    - crossing the road
